# LncExpDB
### Introduction

LncExpDB is a comprehensive database for lncRNA expression. It covers expression profiles of lncRNA genes across various biological [contexts](https://bigd.big.ac.cn/LncExpDB/help#structure), predicts potential functional lncRNAs and their interacting partners, and thus provides essential guidance on experimental design.

LncExpDB currently houses expression profiles of 101,293 high-quality human lncRNA genes derived from 1,977 samples of 337 biological [conditions](https://bigd.big.ac.cn/LncExpDB/help#structure) across nine biological [contexts](https://bigd.big.ac.cn/LncExpDB/help#structure). Consequently, LncExpDB estimates lncRNA genesâ€™ [expression reliability and capacities](https://bigd.big.ac.cn/LncExpDB/capacity), identifies [25,191](https://bigd.big.ac.cn/LncExpDB/featured) featured genes, and further obtains [28,443,865](https://bigd.big.ac.cn/LncExpDB/interactions) lncRNA-mRNA interactions.
